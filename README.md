# Amended writing task

Per my email, I elected to improve the user experience for the documentation. 

This submission proposes [landing page](land.md) and introduction amendments. Note that the landing page's lists would be applied as cards, as implemented in the existing page. I would probably have 2 divs. 1 for learn and 1 for earn (once the learn section is built out) to support different user journeys.

My rationale is that:

1. The current landing page lacks text. 
> Note, that including paragraphs of content with keywords can enhance how snippets are generated for search engine results pages. Keywords on the landing page help Google understand the primary focus and relevance of your site. This can improve click-through rates.

2. As per the existing landing page, this page leads the user deeper into the documentation. 
> I have provided one additional page, an overview [learn](learn.md) page on which I attempted to improve the scaffolding of the existing introduction concepts. Otherwise, all links are to existing pages.

I would retain an introduction page to lead on from the overview/learn page, i.e. the learn.md would be the entry point into learning about the ecosystem and the introduction would act as a more technical page to follow an overview.

This allows you to retain the "explain it like I'm 5" and then dive deeper.
