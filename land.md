## What is Atlas Network?

Atlas Network transforms how decentralized physical infrastructure is provisioned for node networks.

Decentralized compute infrastructures, such as blockchain, must ensure that nodes meet three key criteria: decentralization, security, and reliability, to support the services that depend on them.

Before Atlas Network launched its marketplace, creating a decentralized and economically secure node network presented several challenges:

- Creating your network effect: Either protocols or a community must work to set up a decentralized network; consuming significant time, resources, and capital.
- Security Concerns: A lack of decentralization erodes the economic security necessary to protect node networks from attacks.
- Complexity: Deploying and managing nodes across diverse infrastructure providers is complicated and time-consuming.

Atlas Network tackles these challenges head-on. Whether you are a solo node operator looking to earn; a Gaming, AI, or blockchain protocol looking to ensure decentralization and security; or a platform seeking more validators, Atlas Network gets you more nodes.

From simple, one-click node deployment to provisioning and monitoring a fleet of nodes across a diverse pool of decentralized, secure, and reliable infrastructure providers, Atlas Network is proud to present this pioneering DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) orchestration layer for node networks.
